# booksitter

The college books are expensive and my goal is to help students to find used book in a good condition. 
It's main purpose of the Booksitter app is to connect students who would like to buy the book with those who want to sell the book.

Booksitter project is a graphical application written in Java using Spring Boot, HTML, CSS, Mysql.

This application has two main features:
1. it takes a user request for searching a specific book by the book's name or author's name and search it inside of MySQL database. Then it shows the search result to the user.
2. It takes a user input for selling the book with atributes like book name, author name, condition of the book, price, seller's name, seller's email and seller's phone number. It adds automatically all this data into the MySQL database and confirms to the user that his book was added to the app.
